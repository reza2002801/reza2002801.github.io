## Research Experiences

**Sharif University of Technology**
- **Graph Machine Learning (Bachelor Project)**  
  Supervisor: Prof. Javad Ebrahimi  
  - Completing the knowledge graph of patients in a hospital using Graph neural networks.
  - Performing Node2Vec and Deep Walk on Evolutionary graphs.
  - Conducting Community detection on the knowledge graph data provided by a hospital.
  - Constructing knowledge graph based on data driven from a hospital.

- **Mouse Opto-Locomotor Motion Analysis**  
  Supervisor: Prof. Zahra Rezvani  
  - Designing an attention-based neural network to determine if mice can distinguish between different stimulations based on the time series of mice head degrees.
  - Investigating if mice's previous experience and memory can bias their reaction in current experiments by training a model to distinguish the response of the mouse with different previous experiments.

- **Rank Aggregation**  
  Supervisor: Prof. Shahram Khazaei  
  - Applied genetic algorithms on ranking data with numerous ranking criteria to derive a single criterion that minimizes the deviation from all the basic rankings.
  - Utilized a faster approach, Monte Carlo cross-entropy, to solve this problem.

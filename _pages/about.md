I am Reza Alvandi, a masterâ€™s student in electrical engineering at McGill University. My interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning, Statistics, and Optimization. Having previously studied computer science, I am also passionate about algorithms and software development. At McGill, I focus on designing intelligent systems with mathematical guarantees, particularly for control tasks, using tools such as game theory and machine learning.

Research Interest
======

- Decentralized stochastic control and Markov decision theory
- Reinforcement learning for partially observed systems
- Theoretical Machine learning

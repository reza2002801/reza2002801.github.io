<div style="text-align: justify"> I am Reza Alvandi, a master’s student in electrical engineering at McGill University. My interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning, Statistics, and Optimization. Having previously studied computer science, I am also passionate about algorithms and software development. At McGill, I focus on designing intelligent systems with mathematical guarantees, particularly for control tasks, using tools such as game theory and machine learning. </div>

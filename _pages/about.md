My name is Reza Alvandi, and I am a 4-year Bachelor of Science student in Computer Science at Sharif University of Technology (SUT).

Research Interest
======
I am generally curious about the intersection of Machine Learning, Algorithms, Statistics and Optimization. 

I have worked on:
- Graph Machine Learning models such as GNN and GraphSage
- Mouse Opto-Locomotor Motion Analysis
- Rank Aggregation Optimization
- Reinforcement Learning for Checker games
- Variational Auto encoders to generate data
- Image processing technique in blending images
